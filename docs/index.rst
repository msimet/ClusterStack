ClusterStack: models for lensing signals from cross-correlation measurements
============================================================================

ClusterStack generates models for lensing signals from cross-correlation measurements.  The user
must supply callable functions for the :math:`\Delta\Sigma` model as well as the mass-concentration
relation; prescriptions for scatter are included, and the ClusterStack objects generate Monte Carlo
realizations of the scatter, which converge well as long as the parameter space is well-sampled.

ClusterStack objects, and this package in general, also include convenience functions to allow
sampling via the package `emcee <http://dfm.io/emcee/current/>`_ .
